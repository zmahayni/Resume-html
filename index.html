    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>My name is Zade Mahayni. I am a beginner coder who aims to learn a lot. Currently, I am learning Web Development and Machine Learning in my free time.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>University of Oklahoma (6/2023 - 8/2023)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Research Intern
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analyzed the battery usage of RWIS Stations built by OU. I learned how to handle large amounts of data and how to extract relevant information from the data. RWIS Systems were machines planted on many roads in Oklahoma that monitored the condition of the road and the weather around it. My job was to look at that data, as well as the battery usage and power data, and find a way to optimize the battery usage.

                <li>
                    Research Intern
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analyzed how to optimally implement "smart environment", environments where there were many different types of devices connected to the internet. I specifically worked on researching ways to fingerprint these devices, as well as help develop the database that would store all these items.
